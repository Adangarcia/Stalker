# Stalker-O-Matic [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/TxSSC/Stalker.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/TxSSC/Stalker)

## Installation

Dependencies can be installed using npm (`npm install`). Client dependencies will need to be installed using bower, install bower globally using `npm install -g bower` and run `bower install`.

## Building

This project uses grunt, and both development and projection clients can be built with `grunt development` and `grunt production` respectably. 

## Environment variables

#### STALKER_PORT
##### default: `3000`
Signifies which port the Stalker server should run on

#### API_TOKEN
##### default: `please`
Token that should be used when authenticating against the api in the case that a session or user auth token is not used.

#### SESSION_SECRET
##### default: `dirty secret`
Salt for hashing session cookies. Should just be a random crypto value.

#### CONSUMER_KEY
OAuth2 provider consumer key, you will need this, or you're gonna have a bad time.

#### CONSUMER_SECRET
OAuth2 provider secret, you will also need this, or you're gonna have a doubly bad time.

## Running

Currently Stalker uses the [TxSSC/SSO](https://github.com/TxSSC/SSO) project, which is internal only. It uses passport, so this could easily be substitued for another OAuth2 provider.

To run you will need to get set the appropriate environment variables and run `npm start` or `node app`.

## Testing

Stalker tests can be run with `npm test` or `make test`.

## API
